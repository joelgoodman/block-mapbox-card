# AI INTERACTION GUIDELINES

## CORE PRINCIPLES
- DO NOT modify code outside the specific task being addressed
- ALWAYS ask for explicit confirmation before making changes
- NEVER alter files or code not directly related to the current task
- IF UNSURE, ASK FOR CLARIFICATION

## Workflow
1. Clearly define the exact scope of work
2. Show proposed changes BEFORE implementation
3. Wait for explicit USER approval
4. Make MINIMAL, TARGETED changes only

## Strict Boundaries
- NO UNSOLICITED MODIFICATIONS
- NO REFACTORING WITHOUT DIRECT REQUEST
- NO CHANGES TO:
  * Existing functionality
  * Unrelated files
  * Project structure
